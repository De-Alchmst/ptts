# Plain Text Typesetting System

A nice way to format text to be shown inside terminal / with monospace font.

Both more clasicall and vi-based keybindings are supported in the tui.
Metadata can be shown by pressing 'm'

Currently under developement. `sourcecnfg`, `sourcetxt`, and `sourceall`
are not implemented yet, rest should work.

Work is being done on exporting to pdf (and possibly html).
