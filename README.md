# Plain Text Typesetting System

A nice way to format text to be shown inside terminal / with monospace font.

Both more clasicall and vi-based keybindings are supported in the tui.
Metadata can be shown by pressing 'm'

Currently under developement. `sourcecnfg`, `sourcetxt`, and `sourceall`
are not implemented yet, rest should work.

PDF almost works, LaTeX also works, but is not at all readable.

Fonts are a bit finicky, so when in doubt, copy fonts next to your document.

Font names should be as follows:
```
<fontname>-Regular.{otf|ttf}
<fontname>-Bold.{otf|ttf}
<fontname>-Italic.{otf|ttf}
<fontname>-BoldItalic.{otf|ttf}
```

ptts comes with the [HACK](https://sourcefoundry.org/hack/) font.
